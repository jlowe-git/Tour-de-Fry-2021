### What is the "Tour de Fry"?


###### Get on a bike, ride around Raleigh, stop at places that serve french fries, order french fries, eat french fries.

  &nbsp;

### Why?

  
###### Some of us really like french fries, bikes, and Raleigh, so we combined them.

  &nbsp;

### But isn't it a lil gross to eat so many french fries?

  
###### Yes.

  &nbsp;

### How do I join?

  
###### Mike's Bikes will find you.
